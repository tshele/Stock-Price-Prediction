#GETTING STARTED

* This project can be built with Jupiter or Spyder, in this explanation I am going to use Spyder
* First you need to install TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org), Theano (https://www.deeplearning.net) and Keras (https://www.keras.io) on your computer.
* The dataset can be downloaded on https://archive.ics.uci.edu
* After installing the libraries create a project in Spyder and call it for example main.py(mn.py)
* Then in Spyder go to your file explorer and click on 'set console working directory'
